## üü† HIGH-RISK FINDINGS

### 3. **Weak Access Control in ICP Canister** - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Location:** `src/timer/authorization.mo:18-22`
**Risk:** HIGH ‚Üí **MITIGATED**
**Description:** The authorization system allowed the deployer to automatically grant themselves admin privileges without proper validation.

**‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- **Enhanced authorization module** with comprehensive security checks
- **Added anonymous principal protection** - cannot add anonymous users as admins
- **Added management canister protection** - prevents management canister admin privileges

### 4. **Inadequate Input Validation** - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Location:** `src/timer/main.mo:1047-1060`
**Risk:** HIGH ‚Üí **ELIMINATED**
**Description:** Subscription ID validation was insufficient, allowing potential injection attacks.

**‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- **Comprehensive input validation function** with multiple defense layers
- **Path traversal protection** - blocks `../`, `..\`, `/etc/`, `/usr/`, `%2e%2e`
- **Script injection protection** - blocks `<script`, `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`
- **SQL injection protection** - blocks `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `UNION`, quotes
- **Control character filtering** - blocks null bytes and control characters
- **Character validation** - only alphanumeric + `-` and `_` allowed
- **Length validation** - 4-64 character limits enforced
- **Sequential character protection** - prevents automated attacks with repeated characters
- **Defense in depth approach** - multiple validation layers

**Files Modified:**
- `src/timer/main.mo` - Added `is_valid_subscription_id()` function (lines 1178-1259)

### 5. **Oracle Manipulation Vulnerability** - üîÑ **REMAINING**
**Location:** `solana-contract/ouro_c_subscriptions/src/lib.rs:298-314`
**Risk:** HIGH
**Description:** Price oracle validation lacks sufficient checks against manipulation, potentially allowing attackers to influence swap rates.

**Impact:**
- Financial loss through price manipulation
- Undermining of swap mechanism
- Loss of user funds

**Recommendation:** Implement multiple oracle sources and confidence interval checks.

**Status:** This issue requires further architectural changes and is recommended for the next development phase.

---

## üü° MEDIUM-RISK FINDINGS

### 6. **Replay Attack Vulnerability**
**Location:** `src/timer/solana.mo:300-339`
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Timestamp validation window (5 minutes) is too wide, allowing potential replay attacks.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized transaction replay
- Double-spending opportunities
- Compromise of payment integrity

**Recommendation:** Reduce timestamp validation window to 30-60 seconds and implement nonce-based replay protection.

### 7. **Insufficient Error Handling**
**Location:** Multiple locations in contract code
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Several error conditions don't provide sufficient information for debugging while revealing internal state.

**Impact:**
- Difficult debugging and incident response
- Potential information leakage
- Poor user experience

**Recommendation:** Implement structured error handling with appropriate detail levels for different contexts.

### 8. **Missing Rate Limiting**
**Location:** `src/timer/main.mo:269-360`
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** No rate limiting on subscription creation allows spam attacks.

**Impact:**
- Resource exhaustion
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Spam proliferation

**Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting based on principal identity and subscription volume.

### 9. **Insecure Random Number Generation**
**Location:** Various locations
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** System time and deterministic methods are used where randomness is required.

**Impact:**
- Predictable behavior
- Potential gaming of the system
- Weak security guarantees

**Recommendation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generation from ICP's raw_rand function.

### 10. **Unchecked External Calls**
**Location:** `src/timer/solana.mo:484-503`
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** External RPC calls lack proper validation and error handling.

**Impact:**
- System instability
- Potential for malformed responses
- Cascading failures

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive validation, timeout handling, and circuit breaker patterns for external calls.

### 11. **Privilege Escalation Risk**
**Location:** `src/timer/main.mo:1115-1152`
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Emergency admin functions could be abused for privilege escalation.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized access elevation
- Compromise of system integrity
- Abuse of emergency functions

**Recommendation:** Implement strict controls and auditing for emergency functions.

### 12. **Information Disclosure**
**Location:** Multiple debug statements
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Debug messages and error responses may leak sensitive information.

**Impact:**
- Exposure of internal system details
- Assisted attacker reconnaissance
- Privacy violations

**Recommendation:** Remove debug information from production and sanitize error messages.

### 13. **Denial of Service Vulnerability**
**Location:** `src/timer/main.mo:421-445`
**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Resource exhaustion possible through malicious subscription creation.

**Impact:**
- System unavailability
