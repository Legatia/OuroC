---

## üü† HIGH-RISK FINDINGS

### 1. **Oracle Manipulation Vulnerability** - **OPEN** üîÑ
**Location:** `solana-contract/ouro_c_subscriptions/src/price_oracle.rs:298-314`
**Risk:** HIGH
**Status:** **REQUIRES ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES**

**Issue:** Price oracle validation lacks sufficient checks against manipulation, potentially allowing attackers to influence swap rates.

**Impact:**
- Financial loss through price manipulation
- Undermining of swap mechanism
- Loss of user funds

**Current Implementation:**
```rust
// Basic price validation with insufficient manipulation protection
let price = price_update_data
    .get_price_no_older_than(&Clock::get()?, 60, &feed_id)
    .map_err(|_| ErrorCode::PriceTooOld)?;
```

**Recommendation:**
- Implement multiple oracle sources (Pyth + Chainlink + Switchboard)
- Add confidence interval validation
- Implement circuit breaker for oracle failures
- Add maximum price deviation checks

---

## üü° MEDIUM-RISK FINDINGS

### 1. **Replay Attack Vulnerability**
**Location:** `src/timer/solana.mo:300-339`
**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Timestamp validation window (5 minutes) is too wide, allowing potential replay attacks.

**Current Code:**
```motoko
let max_age_seconds = 300; // 5 minutes - TOO WIDE
require!(verify_timestamp(timestamp, clock.unix_timestamp, max_age_seconds)?);
```

**Recommendation:** Reduce to 30-60 seconds and implement nonce-based replay protection.

### 2. **Insufficient Rate Limiting**
**Location:** `src/timer/main.mo:269-360`
**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** No comprehensive rate limiting on subscription creation allows spam attacks.

**Current Protection:**
```motoko
if (subscriptions.size() >= MAX_TOTAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS) {
    return #err("Maximum total subscriptions reached");
}
```

**Recommendation:** Implement per-principal rate limiting with tier-based limits.

### 3. **Insecure Random Number Generation**
**Location:** Multiple locations
**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** System time and deterministic methods used where randomness is required.

**Recommendation:** Use ICP's `raw_rand` function for cryptographically secure randomness.

### 4. **Unchecked External Calls**
**Location:** `src/timer/solana.mo:484-503`
**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** External RPC calls lack proper validation and error handling.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive validation, timeout handling, and circuit breaker patterns.

### 5. **Weak Input Validation in SDK**
**Location:** `packages/sdk/src/core/OuroCClient.ts`
**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Client-side validation insufficient for security-critical operations.

**Recommendation:** Implement server-side validation for all critical operations.

### 6. **Dependency Security**
**Location:** Multiple package.json files
**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Some dependencies may have known vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:** Implement automated dependency scanning and regular updates.

---

## üü¢ LOW-RISK FINDINGS

### 1. **Code Quality Issues**
- Unused variables and imports in various files
- Inconsistent error messages across components
- Missing comprehensive inline documentation

**Recommendation:** Implement code quality standards and automated linting.

### 2. **Logging Issues**
- Debug logging in production builds
- Inconsistent log formats
- Missing structured security event logging

**Recommendation:** Implement structured logging with appropriate levels and security event tracking.

### 3. **Configuration Security**
- Default configurations suitable for development
- Missing environment-specific configuration management
- Hardcoded network endpoints in some places

**Recommendation:** Implement environment-specific configuration management.

### 4. **Frontend Security**
- Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Insufficient input validation on client side
- Over-reliance on client-side security controls

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive frontend security measures including CSP and proper validation.

### 5. **Testing Gaps**
- Limited integration tests for critical flows
- Missing security-focused test scenarios
- Insufficient edge case coverage

**Recommendation:** Expand test coverage with focus on security scenarios and integration testing.

### 6. **Arcium Integration Not Implemented**
**Location:** Enterprise privacy features
**Risk:** LOW

**Issue:** Arcium MXE integration referenced in documentation but not implemented in code.

**Current Status:** Web Crypto API used instead (production-ready)
**Future Plan:** Arcium MXE planned for Q2 2026

**Recommendation:** Update documentation to clearly distinguish current implementation vs future plans.
