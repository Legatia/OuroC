# OuroC - Vision Document

## Project Overview

OuroC is a fully on-chain subscription management system for Solana that leverages Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as a decentralized timer service. The system enables automated recurring payments without relying on traditional off-chain infrastructure.

## Core Architecture

### Components

1. **Solana Smart Contract (Receiver)**
   - Handles subscription logic and payment collection
   - Receives timer pings from external sources
   - Processes subscription payments when triggered
   - Maintains subscription state and user balances
   - **Design Principle**: Public interface to allow timer source replacement

2. **ICP Canister (Timer Agent)**
   - Utilizes ICP's on-chain timer functionality
   - Monitors subscription schedules
   - Sends minimal SOL transactions to trigger payment collection
   - Leverages ICP's chain fusion capabilities for cross-chain interaction

3. **Cross-Chain Communication**
   - ICP canister sends minimal SOL transactions to Solana
   - Transaction acts as a trigger signal for the Solana contract
   - Solana contract processes the actual subscription payment

## Key Features

### Decentralized Timer System
- No reliance on off-chain cron jobs or centralized services
- ICP's deterministic timer execution
- Fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant

### Modular Timer Interface
- Solana contract designed with public trigger interface
- Easy replacement of timer source (ICP â†’ other solutions)
- Future-proof architecture for emerging timer solutions

### Automated Subscription Management
- Recurring payment collection
- Subscription state management
- User balance tracking
- Payment history and audit trails

## Technical Benefits

1. **Fully On-Chain**: No off-chain dependencies for core functionality
2. **Decentralized**: Leverages multiple blockchain networks for resilience
3. **Modular**: Timer source can be replaced without contract changes
4. **Efficient**: Minimal cross-chain transactions for triggers
5. **Transparent**: All subscription logic visible and verifiable on-chain

## Use Cases

- SaaS subscription payments in crypto
- DeFi protocol recurring fees
- DAO membership dues
- Content creator subscriptions
- Service provider recurring billing

## Future Extensibility

The modular design allows for:
- Alternative timer sources (other blockchains, oracle networks)
- Enhanced subscription features (pause/resume, tier changes)
- Multi-token support
- Cross-chain subscription management

## Success Metrics

- Reliable timer execution with <1% failure rate
- Sub-minute latency for subscription processing
- Gas-efficient operations on both chains
- Seamless timer source migration capability
